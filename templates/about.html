                        </p>
                        <li>Most people donâ€™t know sign language which often times creates a communication barrier. </li>
                         <li>So,The purpose of this project is to eliminate this particular barrier and make the process of communication easier. </li>
                         <li>we are going to devised a system that converts sign language into text and into speech as well. </li>

                        <p>
                            It's basically convertING sign to text and to notch up iT we are than  converting it in speech as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It snap the image  and  predict the gesture of the image so whatever sign we want,it will predict and give it in a text form with it's threshold and then it convert it into speech(if want) .
                            if user want to save so it can save else it will reset and again the process repeated.

                      A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

                        OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.

Python is a general purpose programming language started by Guido van Rossum that became very popular very quickly, mainly because of its simplicity and code readability. It enables the programmer to express ideas in fewer lines of code without reducing readability.
